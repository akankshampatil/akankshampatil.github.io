  <h2>Analog Integrated Circuit Design Project</h2>
  <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Jan â€“ Apr 2024</p>

  <p>
    This project focuses on designing a <strong>high-gain, two-stage operational amplifier</strong> for analog signal processing using the <strong>TSMC 0.4Î¼m CMOS process</strong> in Cadence Virtuoso. 
    The op-amp was carefully simulated for <strong>DC gain, phase margin, gain-bandwidth product (GBW), output swing, and slew rate</strong>. The final design achieved a <strong>DC gain of 2756.25 V/V</strong> and 
    a <strong>phase margin of 53Â°</strong> with a 5pF load, operating on a 3.2V single supply.
  </p>

  <p>
    The architecture included a differential input stage, current mirror load, Miller compensation capacitor, and biasing through a separate current reference block. Simulations included 
    <strong>AC sweep, transient response, and DC operating point analysis</strong>. Trade-offs between gain, area, and power were thoroughly evaluated.
